# TensorFlow with Cloud Practice 
CIFAR-10 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) — trained on both **AWS EC2** and **Azure Virtual Machines** using TensorFlow.

---

## Project Overview

This self-implemted project demonstrates how to:
- Build and train a CNN for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Run training on **cloud CPU/GPU environments** (AWS EC2, Azure VM) with compatability
- Track metrics using both **CSVLogger** and **TensorBoard**
- Save trained models in `.h5` format
- Contain with Docker for future useage
